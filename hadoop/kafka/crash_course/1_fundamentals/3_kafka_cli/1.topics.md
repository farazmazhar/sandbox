# Apache Kafka - Kafka CLI - Topics

Note: Make sure Zookeeper and Kafka servers are up and running.

```sh
# Start zookeeper server.
./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

# Start kafka server.
./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

# Run `kafka-topics.sh` to get the options.
./bin/kafka-topics.sh
```

## Create a topic

```sh
# Give following arguments for `kafka-topics.sh`:
# --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181            Where Zookeeper server is running.
# --create                              Tell that you want to create a topic.
# --topic first_topic                   Name of the topic.
# --partitions 3                        How many partition do you want?
# --replication-factor 1                How much replication do you want? This can't be more than the number of Brokers.

./bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --create --topic FirstTopic --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
```

```bat
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --create --topic FirstTopic --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
```

## List existing topics

```sh
# Give following arguments for `kafka-topics.sh`:
# --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181            Where Zookeeper server is running.
# --list                                List all the topics.

./bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --list
```

```bat
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --list
```

## Describe a topic

```sh
# Give following arguments for `kafka-topics.sh`:
# --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181            Where Zookeeper server is running.
# --describe                            Describe a topic.
# --topic first_topic                   Name of the topic.

./bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --describe --topic FirstTopic
```

## Delete a topic

Note: According to the course, deleting topic on Windows can crash Kafka. Although there is a possibility that this issue might have been fixed, recommended way to go about it would be to test this. If it crashes, delete the folder for the topic from `log.dirs`(server.properties) location.

```sh
# Give following arguments for `kafka-topics.sh`:
# --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181            Where Zookeeper server is running.
# --delete                              Describe a topic.
# --topic first_topic                   Name of the topic.

./bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --delete --topic FirstTopic
```
