# Apache Kafka - Kafka CLI - Consumer Groups CLI

Note: Make sure Zookeeper and Kafka servers are up and running, and there topics present.

```sh
# Start zookeeper server.
./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

# Start kafka server.
./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

# Run `kafka-topics.sh` to get the options.
./bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh
```

## List consumer groups

```sh
# Give following arguments for `kafka-consumer-groups.sh`:
# --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092                 Address of Kafka server (similar to producer's broker option).
# --list                                            List all the consumer groups.

./bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --list
```

<!-- for Kafka <=2.0 only -->
Note: If you see consumer groups that you didn't create, it means that Kafka created those groups when there was no group specified.

## Describe a consumer group

This can also be used to find out where the consumers are running and related information.

```sh
# Give following arguments for `kafka-consumer-groups.sh`:
# --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092                 Address of Kafka server (similar to producer's broker option).
# --group nice_group                                Name of the group.
# --describe                                        List all the consumer groups.

./bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --group nice_group --describe
```
