# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Brokers

- A Kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers (servers).
- Each broker is basically a server.
- Each broker is identified with its ID (integer).
- Each broker contains certain topic partitions.
- After connecting to any broker (called a bootstrap broker), you will be connected to the entire cluster.
- A good number to get started is 3 brokers, but some big clusters have over 100 brokers.

## Example: Brokers and Topics

1. Topic-A with 3 partitions
2. Topic-B with 2 partitions

- Broker 101
  - Topic-A Partition 0
  - Topic-B Partition 1
- Broker 102
  - Topic-A Partition 2
  - Topic-B Partition 0
- Broker 103
  - Topic-A Partition 1

Note: The data is distributed and Broker 103 doesn't have any Topic-B data.
