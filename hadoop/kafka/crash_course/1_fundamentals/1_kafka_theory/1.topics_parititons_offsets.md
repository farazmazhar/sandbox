# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Topics, Partitions, and Offsets

- **Topics**: A particular stream of data.
  - Similar to a table in database (without all the constraints)
  - You can have as many topics as you want.
  - A topic is identified by its name.
- Topics are split in **paritions**.
  - Each parition is ordered.
  - Each message within a partition gets an incremental id, called **offset**.
- Offset only have a meaning for a specific parition.
  - I.e. offset 3 of partition 0 doesn't represenet the same data as offset 3 in partition 1.
- Order is guaranteed only within a partition, not across partitions.
- Data is *kept only for a limited time* (default is one week).
- Offsets keep incrementing i.e. once the stream has started, it won't ever comeback to a previous offset like 0 etc.
- Once the data is written to a partition, *it can't be changed* (immutibility).
- Data is sent randomly sent to partitions, unless provided a key.

## Example

### Truck GPS

- Say you have a fleet of trucks, each truck reports its GPS position to Kafka.
- You can have a topic *trucks_gps* that contains the posititon of all trucks.
- Each truck will send a message to Kafka every 20 seconds, each message will contain the truck ID and the truck position (lat / long).
- We choose to create that topic with 10 paritions (arbitrary number).
