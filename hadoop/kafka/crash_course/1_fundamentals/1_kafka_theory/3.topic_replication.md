# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Topic Replication

- When there is distribution, you need replication to increase availablity.
- Topics should have a replication factor > 1 (usually between 2 and 3[gold standard]).
- This way if a broker is down, another broker can serve the data.
  
## Example

- Topic-A with 2 partitions and replication factor of 2.

- Broker 101
  - Topic-A Parititon 0 (Leader)
- Broker 102
  - Topic-A Parititon 1 (Leader)
  - Topic-A Parititon 0 (ISR)
- Broker 103
  - Topic-A Parititon 1 (ISR)

If a broker (say Broker 102) goes down Broker 101, and 102 can serve the data.

## Concept of Leader for a partition

- At an time only, ONE broker can be a leader for a given partition.
- Only that leader can recieve and serve data for partition.
- The other brokers will synchronize the data.
- Therefor each partition has one leader and multiple ISR (in-sync repilica).
- Leader and ISR is determined by Zookeeper.
