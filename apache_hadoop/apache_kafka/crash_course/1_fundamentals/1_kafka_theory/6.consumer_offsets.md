# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Consumer Offsets and Delivery Semantics

## Consumer Offsets

- Kafka stores the offsets at which a consumer group has been reading (like checkpointing or bookmarking).
- THe offsets committed live in a Kafka topic named *__consumer_offsfets*.
- When a consumer in a group has processed data recieved from Kafka, it should be committing the offsets.
- Why? If a consumer dies, it will be able to read back from where it left off.

## Delivery Semantics For Consumers

- Consumers choose when to commit offsets.
- There are 3 delivery semantics:
  - At most once:
    - Offsets are committed as soon as the message is recieved.
    - If the processing goes wrong, the message will be lost (it won't be read again).
  - At least once (usually preferred):
    - Offsets are committed after the message is processed.
    - If the processing goes wronng, the message will be read again.
    - This can result in duplicate processing of messages. Make sure your processing is **idempotent** (i.e. processing again the messages won't impact your systems).
    - Exactly once:
      - Can be achieved for Kafka to Kafka workflows using Kafka Streams API.
      - For Kafka to External Systems workflows, use an **idempotent** consumer.
