# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Consumers

- Consumers read data from a topic (identified by name).
- Consumers know which broker to read from.
- In case of broker failuers, consumers know how to recover.
- Data is read in order *within each partitions*.
- Consumers can read from multiple partitions.
  - Although by partition the data is going to be inorder but between partitions there isn't going to be a guaranteed ordering.
  
## Consumer Groups

- Consumers read data in consumer groups.
- Each consumer within a group reads from exclusive partitions.
- If you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be inactive.

Note: Consumers will automatically use a GroupCoordinator and a ConsumerCoordinator to assign a consumer to a partition.

### Too Many Consumers In A Consumer Group

- If you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be inactive.
