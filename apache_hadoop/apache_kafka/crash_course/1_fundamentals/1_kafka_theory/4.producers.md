# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Producers

- Producers write data to topics (which is made of partitions).
- Producers automatically know to which broker and partition to write to.
- In case of Broker failures, Producers will automatically recover.
- The load is balanced to many broekrs, thanks to the number of partitions.

## Acknowledgement

- Producers can choose to recieve achknowledgement of data writes:
  - acks=0: Producer won't wait for acknowledgement (possible data loss).
  - acks=1: Producer will wait for leader acknowledgement (limited data loss / default).
  - acks=all: Leader + replicas acknowledge (no data loss).

## Message keys

- Producers can choose to send a key with the message (string, number, etc).
- If `key=null`, data is sent round robin (broker 101 then broker 102 then broker 103 and so on).
- If a key is sent, then all messages for that key will always go to the same partition.
- A key is basically sent if you need message ordering for a specific field (ex: truck_id [see 'Truck GPS' example in Topics, Partitions, and Offsets]).
  - Key hashing is used to guarantee which depends on the number of partitions.
