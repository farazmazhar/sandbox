# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Kafka Guarantees

- Messages are appended to a topic-partition in the order they are sent.
- Consumers read messages in the order stored in a topic-partition.
- With a replication factor of N, producers and consumers can tolerate up to N-1 broker being down.
- This is why a replication factor of 3 is a good idea:
  - Allows for one broker to be taken down for maintenance.
  - Allows for another broker to be taken down unexpectedly.
- As long as the number of partitions remains constant for a topic (no new partitions), the same key will always go to the same partition.
