# Apache Kafka - Kafka Theory - Zookeeper

- Zookeeper manages brokers (keeps a list of them).
- Zookeeper helps in performing leader election for partitions.
- Zookeeper sends notifications to Kafka in case of changes (e.g. new topic, broker dies, broker comes up, delet topics, etc).
- ***Kafka can't work without Zookeeper***.
- Zookeeper by design operates with an odd number of server (3, 5, 7).
- Zookeeper has a leader (handles writes) and the rest of the servers are followers (handle reads).
- Zookeeper does NOT store consumer offsets with Kafka >0.10.
